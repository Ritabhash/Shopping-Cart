Tee Hees provides a fairly thick quality t-shirt.Some of our blank models are actually quite soft. We have a wide variety to choose from including 22 types of basic style blanks. The most popular blank models are the 1901 Adult Short Sleeve Tee, 5301 Menâ€™s Fine Jersey Fitted Tee and 1701 Ringspun Tee. The 1901 is a very basic t shirt blank that is 5.5 oz and 100% preshrunk cotton. The 5301 is more of a fashion style t-shirt that is 4.3 oz and 100% combed preshrunk cotton. The 1701 is a softer version of their basic t-shirt which is 5.5 oz and 100% ringspun preshrunk cotton.

The available colors for Tee Hees blanks are fairly average. Some models offer a wider range of colors than others, but they tend to stay on the dark side. We will cover all of the basics such as black, white and gray without a problem. We do however have some unusual color choices such as mustard and banana that might be appealing to some people on preorder.
